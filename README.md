## This code was developed for educational purposes as an assignment for Phase 2 of the residency program in the **EmbarcaTech professional training program**, with the goal of demonstrating some of the concepts learned during the residency.

## Third-Party Code

- The files for controlling the **OLED display** (`ssd1306_...` files), including the text fonts, were based on the repository:  
  https://github.com/BitDogLab/BitDogLab-C/tree/main/display_oled_logo/inc with minor modifications.
- The `pico_sdk_import.cmake` file was **automatically generated** during project creation by the **Raspberry Pi Pico plugin**.
- The `CMakeLists.txt` file was initially **automatically generated** during project creation by the **Raspberry Pi Pico plugin**, and later edited as needed for the project.

## How to Build/Compile the Code

This software was developed for the **BitDogLab V6.3** board. This board uses the **Raspberry Pi Pico_W** board (which contains the **RP2040 microcontroller**).

For development, the **Visual Studio Code IDE** was used along with the **Raspberry Pi Pico plugin**. The SDK version used was **2.2.0**.
